        Greece is a peninsula and for the most part it is mountainous. It is
        located on the eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea and it borders with
        other Balkan countries to the north, as well as Turkey to the east. With
        a total area of 130.800 km2 and a land area of 130,647 km2, the country
        is surrounded by the sea on three sides. Greece has the longest
        coastline in Europe and the 5th longest coastline in the world, while it
        also has the 10th place in the list of countries with the most islands.
