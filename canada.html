    <h2>Canada</h2>
    <h4>
      Canada is country in North America, with ten provinces and three territories
      extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Artic 
      Ocean. Canada covers 9.98 million square kilometres, which makes it the worlds
      second-largest country by total area. I have family who have migrated to Canada.

        Canada has so much to see, so many National Parks and Reservations and the Government are planning
        on openning new Parks. There is a lot of snow and some provinces like Alberta which is near the mountains
        can reach temperatures of -22.
        In rural provinces it is not strange to see Bear and Cyote warnings especially before Bears are due to go into
        hibernation.
